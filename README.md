# SpaceInvaders
A COMP2207 LaFortuna Project

Welcome to my version of space invaders built for the LaFortuna. The game features a space ship (you) defending your galaxy from invasion against an army of space invaders. 

## Instructions
1. Use the rotary encoder to steer your ship
2. Use the centre button to fire your lazer cannon (Invaders are killed by lazer beams)
3. Dodge alien projectiles. If you get hit you lose a life.
4. You have 3 lives.
5. Once all invaders are dead you win.
